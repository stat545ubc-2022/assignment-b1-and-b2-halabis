# Making a Function

This project requires us to build a function of our choosing. I have
chose to create a function that allows me to seamlessly run several
summary statistics at one for a variable in my dataset. To produce
summary statistics for a variable in my dataset from my STAT 545A data
analysis project, I had to copy-paste the same code and change the
variables each time, as well as changing the dataset when I wanted to
explore each dataset. I want to make it easier to run summary statistics
for different datasets by creating a function that does so.
Additionally, I consistently had to use the function group_by() and
change the column I would like to group by. This became tedious
everytime I want to run group_by() %\>% summarise().

## Libraries

Below are the relevant libraries to my function building, as well as
libraries required to run my examples.

## My Function and Documentation

To produce summary statistics for many variables in my dataset from my
STAT 545A data analysis project, I had to copy-paste the same code and
change the variables each time, as well as changing the dataset when I
wanted to explore each dataset. I want to make it easier to run summary
statistics for different datasets by creating a function that does so.
Additionally, I consistently had to use the function group_by() and
change the variable. This became tedious everytime I want to run
group_by() %\>% summarise().

*NOTE: I enter an na.rm = FALSE as there are instances where an
individual might want to see stats of the NA’s in their data (such as
count n=n()). I also input na.rm=na.rm in order to ensure that whatever
argument that is specified in the function parameters is applied to each
summary statistic rather than having to manually input it.*

``` r
#' Function for Summary Statistics
#' 
#' @description Function that takes inputs of your dataset of interest, column by which you want to group data, and variable for which you want to run summary statistics #' and produces summary statistics. I have also added a custom error message if the inputted variable is not numeric. 
#' 
#' @param data dataset which includes all required variables for the function
#' @param col column name by which other variables will be grouped by
#' @param var variable for which we want to obtain summary statistics
#' @param na.rm set default as FALSE and can be specified with TRUE as needed
#' 
#' @return the function will return a tibble including the count of the variable per group of the col param, as well as columns for each summary statistics in the       #' function per group.
#' 

summary_function <- function(data, col, var, na.rm = FALSE) {
  if(!is.numeric(data %>% pull({{var}}))){
    stop("Sorry! Variable must be numeric!")
  }
  data %>%
    group_by({{col}}) %>%
    summarise(n=n(), mean = mean({{var}}, na.rm = na.rm), median = median({{var}}, na.rm = na.rm), min = min({{var}}, na.rm = na.rm), max = max({{var}}, na.rm = na.rm), sd= sd({{var}}, na.rm = na.rm))
}
```

## Examples

My first example will be using some datasets from **datateachr**
(*cancer_sample, flow_sample, vancouver_trees*) to demonstrate instances
of where the function should work and an example of where my custom
error message will show:

``` r
#summary stats for radius_mean variable in cancer dataset 
#this is an example of where a function would work

cancer_sample %>% 
  summary_function(diagnosis, radius_mean)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 7
    ##   diagnosis     n  mean median   min   max    sd
    ##   <chr>     <int> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 B           357  12.1   12.2  6.98  17.8  1.78
    ## 2 M           212  17.5   17.3 11.0   28.1  3.20

``` r
#identical to previous chunk except I am showing that you can input data into function instead of using a pipe if you want

summary_function(cancer_sample, diagnosis, radius_mean)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 7
    ##   diagnosis     n  mean median   min   max    sd
    ##   <chr>     <int> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 B           357  12.1   12.2  6.98  17.8  1.78
    ## 2 M           212  17.5   17.3 11.0   28.1  3.20

``` r
#summary stat for flow_sample dataset
#this is an example of where the function requires na.rm = TRUE argument, as otherwise we will see NA's in the minimum row

flow_sample %>% 
  summary_function(extreme_type, flow, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 7
    ##   extreme_type     n   mean median    min    max     sd
    ##   <chr>        <int>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1 maximum        109 212.   204    107    466    61.7  
    ## 2 minimum        109   6.27   6.15   3.62   8.44  0.965

``` r
#showing what the previous chunk shows if I leave the na.rm as the default specified in my function for a dataset with NA's

flow_sample %>% 
  summary_function(extreme_type, flow)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 7
    ##   extreme_type     n  mean median   min   max    sd
    ##   <chr>        <int> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 maximum        109  212.    204   107   466  61.7
    ## 2 minimum        109   NA      NA    NA    NA  NA

``` r
#summary stat for vancouver_trees dataset
# this is an example of where the function will not work because of a non-numeric argument in the variable parameter

vancouver_trees %>% 
  summary_function(tree_id, genus_name)
```

    ## Error in summary_function(., tree_id, genus_name): Sorry! Variable must be numeric!

Now I will use the **gapminder** dataset to further exemplify when the
function should and shouldn’t work:

``` r
#test from gapminder dataset
#this is an example of where the function will work as the variable parameter is numeric

gapminder %>% summary_function(continent, lifeExp)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 7
    ##   continent     n  mean median   min   max    sd
    ##   <fct>     <int> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Africa      624  48.9   47.8  23.6  76.4  9.15
    ## 2 Americas    300  64.7   67.0  37.6  80.7  9.35
    ## 3 Asia        396  60.1   61.8  28.8  82.6 11.9 
    ## 4 Europe      360  71.9   72.2  43.6  81.8  5.43
    ## 5 Oceania      24  74.3   73.7  69.1  81.2  3.80

``` r
#test from gapminder dataset
#this is an example of where the function won't work because the variable parameter is not numeric

gapminder %>% summary_function(continent, country)
```

    ## Error in summary_function(., continent, country): Sorry! Variable must be numeric!

## Function Test

Here I will test 3 critical things; 1. Will the function give me my
customized error message if I input a non-numeric variable parameter?

2.  Is the returned output I get from my function identical to that
    which I get if I run the original pipeline without my function?

3.  Will the returned output be a tibble as expected by my function?

``` r
#I will first run my test functions on several datasets at once to demonstrate the variety of things that can occur with my summary function (expected errors, expected identical outputs, expected tibble output)
#Using datateachr package: vancouver_trees, building_permits, and cancer_sample datasets

test_that("This is a test for my summary function", {
  expect_error(summary_function(vancouver_trees, tree_id, genus_name)) #Test whether an error message is given if variable is non-numeric
  expect_error(summary_function(building_permits, type_of_work, property_use)) #Another error test 
  expect_equal((summary_function(cancer_sample, diagnosis, radius_mean)),
                   (cancer_sample %>% 
                      group_by(diagnosis) %>% 
                      summarise(n=n(), mean = mean(radius_mean), median = median(radius_mean), min = min(radius_mean), max = max(radius_mean), sd = sd(radius_mean)))) #Test whether the function gives identical result as manual input
  expect_true(is_tibble(summary_function(cancer_sample, diagnosis, radius_mean))) #Test that the output is a tibble table
  }
  )
```

    ## Test passed 🥳

``` r
#If I am testing all on the same dataset, let's try gapminder data with the same expect_() functions from the above chunk

test_that("This is a test for my summary function on gapminder data", {
  expect_error(summary_function(gapminder, continent, country)) #Test whether an error message is given if variable is non-numeric
  expect_equal((summary_function(gapminder, continent, lifeExp)),
                   (gapminder %>% 
                      group_by(continent) %>% 
                      summarise(n=n(), mean = mean(lifeExp), median = median(lifeExp), min = min(lifeExp), max = max(lifeExp), sd = sd(lifeExp)))) #Test whether the function gives identical result as manual input
  expect_true(is_tibble(summary_function(gapminder, continent, lifeExp))) #Test that the output is a tibble table
  }
  )
```

    ## Test passed 🎉

All my tests passed!!

## I can confirm that my function:

1.  Does not rely on anything from a working environment

2.  Does not rely on magic numbers

3.  Does not take an input of rigid form

4.  Has a consistent output of a tibble

5.  Includes appropriate arguments (ex. how it handling NA’s)
